What Self-Sufficiency means....

## In terms of living in a city
Self-Sufficenty inside a city sounds like a paradox. But in reality it's more of a philosophy of autonomy. 
    1. To move freely throughout the city. 
    2. To choose where to live in a city. 
As a city the goal is to:
    1. Provide a good quality of life to all it's inhabitants
    2. Require as little external funding for ongoing projects. 
    3. Provide the opportunity of autonomy to as many citizens as possible



## In terms of living outside the city
This is the definition that most people are most familiar with. 
    1. Homesteading in a sustainable method



So, how do these two things connect with Sustainability and Environmentalism let alone technology? 


Ultimately, there should be a choice that every individual makes throughout their life on how to live and where to live. This choice should not be permanent, and a change doesn't mean that they were wrong in any way. 
At the root of their decision should be the conscious effort to be as environmentally sustainable as possible and have as minimal an impact on others. 

Those who choose to live in either need to understand that they will always have an effect on the environment. It should be imperative, that they attempt to use the finite resources on Earth as efficently as possible and minimize the damage done to the environment.
