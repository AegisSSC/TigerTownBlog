    Ok so now that we got through all of the first post stuff, now onto the first first post. Or in this case, the second post. 

    What will this post be about? Well, the biggest thing that is going on in my professional development life at the time... Unemployment. Yep. That's right, Unemployment. But don't worry, this isn't a sappy post, or even a pity party. I want to take this time to really focus on what I am doing to keep myself sane and working towards the goal of employment again. 

## The Why

    Why? Why what? Why am I unemployed? That's an easy question: I don't have a job. Duh... But in all seriousness, I was working for a very small company based just outside of the small town where I went to University. Of the eight full-time employees, three of them were well over the age of retirement, and I was by a wide margin, the youngest person on the payroll. I had a job during the later part of my time at University, but part-time student employment opportunities at my Alma Mater were capped in pay, so much so that when I was handed my first monthly paycheck at my full-time job, I was holding more money in my hands than the previous 5 months of work for the University was valued at. Now, in June, three weeks after graduating, it felt as if I had everything to prove to justify being here, despite being under what was considered "under market" for my general region. 

    I battled with myself for quite a while dealing with Imposter's Syndrome since I was mostly left to "read through the codebase" for the better half of two months after a one week onboarding where I learned a bit more about the company. The company was so small, I had a shared office with another engineer, and the CTO. For days at a time it felt like I wasn't able to find anything to start working on and with the CTO sitting behind me, it felt like I was under constant surveillance. This continued until I was handed my first solo project in October. 

    Imposter's Syndrome is something that I still deal with from day to day and this is more common in the software field than anyone cares to admit. The only way that I found to realistically handle this was to build a consistent schedule that you can stick to, and stop comparing yourself to anyone else near you. I have a long history of playing video games and so I think the best analogy that I can give is Software Engineering is a PvE game that has been disguised as a PvP game. You are only ever competing against yourself and anyone who tells you otherwise is trying to sell you something or trying to buy something from you at a discount. This is a difficult field and simply by improving year over year will put you miles ahead of anyone who is joining the field and prevent you from falling into the Career Junior Developer position. Additionally, I think it is critical that you accept that you cannot do everything and it is ok to ask for help. Software has grown exponentially since even the beginning of my software career and it is impossible to keep up with every little thing for every language. Pick a few that you really like and become an expert in those. I'm not saying put blinders on and ignore what is outside of your scope of expertise, but rather, acknowledge that there is new stuff out there, but you don't have to immediately pick it up because more often than not, it will be replaced 3 times over before you ever get proficient. So find what you enjoy working in, and work over time to become an expert. 

    I know that doesn't really sound like much of how to cope with and overcome Imposter's Syndrome, but I encourage you to try it. Pick up a project, and go as deep as you can on it. Find out every little detail and truly understand every detail that goes into it. This level of discovery and mastery will build your confidence when you move onto the next project since there is less that you will have to learn and you will be able to get the project done faster, hopefully with less iterations. Imposter's Syndrome goes away when you regain confidence in your own ability, and the only way to improve your confidence is to get back to the

    So back to The Why. Unemployment is a trying time, but it is also a chance for you to finally work on projects that you've wanting to but never had the chance to. This is ultimately how I've viewed my own unemployment and how I've managed to stay grounded during this adversity. That's it. There's no other secret. Unemployment isn't a chance to stay on the sidelines and hope another team picks you up. It's a chance to work on your own projects and improve your skills.
