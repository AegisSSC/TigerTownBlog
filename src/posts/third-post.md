### The First Project

    See, the company I worked for wasn't like many other software companies. We created our own bespoke solution for order fulfillment. This usually meant that when we had a project, usually you would have a few weeks to configure the base software to marry up to a Warehouse Management System (WMS) before going on-site, installing the all of the hardware, running testing, debugging, hand tuning specific variables and then go-live all in a month or two. Usually, these would be paired up as one senior engineer, and one junior engineer. Well, due to other deadlines delaying the (assigned) senior engineer, I was sent out on a project, less than 3 months on the job, by myself and left to face a warehouse general manager, and company owner who was not introduced to me. 

    Ultimately, this was one of the best learning opportunities that I could have asked for. In the past, I have had to manage projects and my previous role at the University IT Call Center, I was not completely helpless with discussing timelines and project status to non-technical personnel. But the project that was supposed to be completed on November to align with their peak season, did not see go-live until January due to external circumstances with other contractors. 

    Through this opportunity, I regained my confidence in my own ability while also discovering shortcomings that usually plague smaller companies such as a nonexisting Ticketing System, lack of Software Version Control, no structured communication outside of email and phone calls, and no way of knowing of new or upcoming projects from management. So following my retrospective review of this project, I mentioned that these should be things that we could possibly invest in as we continue to expand.
