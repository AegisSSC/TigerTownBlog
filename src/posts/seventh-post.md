It's literally the second brain. 

So during all of my time learning the thing that I learned the least about was how to learn. You know, the process in which you are supposed to learn things. It's never really talked about until after you're away from school, or at least it was for me. 

Every year around the summer time I do a weekly or monthly dive into productivity and get swallowed whole by the ocean of content about productivity. After going through this phase for the fourth time, I am here to say that most of it is not actually beneficial. A lot of it is people who are showing you what they do and not really diving deep into why it works for them or how you can utilize the underlying concepts. It's just "Hey look at me! Copy what I am doing and you'll be as successful as I am doing X Job for Y major company that you recognize. Completely missing that these people have iterated over their own system for multiple years and are only showing you a {whatever youtube's algorithm currently says is the minimum time slot to be promoted} version of what could be years of work refining a system over time. Or that they are the type of person that doesn't need a super customized system and so they can put together a quick sponsored piece for a productivity software and it works for them. 

It looks so easy to just passively listen to what they have to say, and take the shill and try the product. I am speaking from experience when it comes to this stuff. I can hold onto a project for a week or two before I toss it and return to what I was doing and resign until the next time that I feel an urge to come back to this topic. 

So what has changed to the 2024 iteration of this seemingly never ending quest? No longer am I in search for the perfect tool to satisfy my requirements. I searched for a methodology in which to network together information and then build a toolkit to satisfy my needs. I sat down and determined that I liked the concept of having a "second brain" in which I can more succinctly house thoughts and connect thought together 

In comes the concept of a Zettelkasten. The idea was originally brought to my attention while listening to [Mischa van den Burg] on a drive back from my girlfriend's apartment. The video can be boiled down to: Here is my system to support my specific method of taking notes, the requirements that I defined from this methodology for note taking, and how I integrate Zettelkasten and the tools I use to support it into my personal workflow. What set this video apart from the others was it's focus on the method for note taking rather than a specific tool that does everything for you and lives in a walled garden that requires a separate tool and doesn't have any ties in with anything else. Instead, the goal was to start with a tool that does one thing really well and has the plugins and flexibility to fit into the side of the ecosystem that you already use. 

Mischa followed the course that he needed to be able to manipulate files from the terminal in his editor of choice (neovim), connect the other parts of his Apple based ecosystem to this system citing that he will have ideas as he is out hiking. He also wanted a simple syntax in which to build his notes with. Ergo, he paired Obsidian to locally host a Markdown based directory. This also has support for other devices and (if you purchase the Obsidian Sync feature or use iCloud backups) can mirror the directory between devices.  All of these were features that I had used in the past with Obsidian, but that wasn't what I was most interested in since this just looked like an endorsement for Obsidian, a tool I had discarded. 

Ultimately, the Zettelkasten was at the center of it and it was what I was most interested in. 

## So what __IS__ Zettelkasten

A Zettelkasten is a method for creating and storing notes in a way that allows you to quickly reference information and link ideas together to synthesize ideas later. The idea originates from a German Sociologist Niklas Luhmann by which he had a physical set of note cards that he organized into a drawer system. This system allowed him to store notes of various types to later process into more formal and permanent notes to reference later when it comes time to write up an article. The system is comprised of two containers a Reference Box, and a Main Box. The Reference Box contains permanent notes about a wide variety of topics that are sorted by keywords that you would want to associate all the ideas together with.  The "Main Box" is meant to be much larger and contains a wide variety of ideas, theories, arguments, and discussions that can then rely on more polished notes in the Reference Box for support.  

For Example of how this system works. This article originated as an idea. The original idea was about how my workflow has changed since adopting this methodology. The permanent note that I reference about Zettelkasten, Niklas Luhmann, productivity, and another about Mischa's Video that were all tied to Zettelkasten as the main idea. This allows for more powerful recall since I could access all of this information in the future simply by recalling a single central idea. 


## How does my System Differ?
Well, I didn't quite adopt the original system. After all, since you are writing out every thought, there's a lot to write, and I don't have the time nor patience to write all of it down and organize physical notes. So, a huge difference that I did was to adopt an electronic version of the system. 
Additionally, I broke up my two boxes into five. FIVE?!?! Yes, Five. 

- Inbox:
    - My Inbox is where all of my unsorted notes and ideas live. 
    - Notes should only live here for up to a maximum of a week. 

- Projects:
    - This is where I keep Reference material that pertains to a specific active project. 
    - Notes here should be more polished, but aren't set in stone. 

- Areas:
    - While it is currently not in use, this is where information pertaining to "Areas of Interest" will live. 

- Resources:
    - Contains notes that don't pertain to any particular project, but are still used. 
    - Contains Notes that are related to more personal information
    - Contains Ideas that could be taken at a later time and moved into Projects after another one comes out. 
    - Contains Reference Notes to things I am currently learning. 

- Archive:
    - Contains Polished notes. 
    - Retired projects live here.
    - Finished Projects live here.


Ultimately, this is meant to be a living document as is everything I touch, but this is how I currently plan on using the system. I think that once a year I will revisit this topic and show you how this has changed.
