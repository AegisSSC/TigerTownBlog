<h2> Hi! </h2>
<p> 
    My Name is Brandon Wingard. 
    I am a Software Engineer currently based in Greenville, South Carolina. 
    I am a Class of 2022 Clemson University Alumnus where I majored in Computer Science and minored in Engineering Systems.  
    My background is primarily in C/C++, Python, and Rust (now including Svelte!) where I've worked on a combination of 
    robotics, data science, and Full-Stack Software Development. In addition, I also have interests in photography and motorsports, where I regularly attend local events.
